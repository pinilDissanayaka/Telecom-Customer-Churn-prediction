## What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company, stop using its products or services, or switch to a competitor. It is a key metric for businesses, particularly in industries where customer retention is crucial for long-term success.Reducing customer churn is often a priority for businesses, as acquiring new customers can be more costly than retaining existing ones. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn and implementing strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty are essential for maintaining a healthy and sustainable customer base. Analyzing customer feedback, providing excellent customer service, and continuously improving products or services are some common approaches to reduce churn.
